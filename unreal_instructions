create epic games account+github, link the two 
when linked, you will get an invite to the private epicgames developers repository (https://github.com/orgs/EpicGames/teams/developers)
download the desired version of unreal engine from this private repo https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine
    we used 4.27: https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/tree/4.27
    git clone did not work for me, can go to the branch, click <> code, then download zip and extract,
then run UnrealEngine/Setup.sh
    $ cd UnrealEngine
    $ bash Setup.sh
Generate project files:
    $ bash GenerateProjectFiles.sh
then do make:
    $ make
launch UE4E from the directory where you have UnrealEngine- ./Engine/Binaries/Linux/UE4Editor
Select the existing environment or create a new environment
If selcecting an existing environment, once it prompts you to convert the project before opening, select more options and click on skip conversion. This will then load the existing environment.
